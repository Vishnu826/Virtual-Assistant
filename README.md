# Virtual-Assistant
This is my Virtual Assistant program written in python. Here, I utilized a various amount of modules, like the WolframAlpha module and the Wikipedia module. Overall, the code is not very neat, but I feel like I did a pretty good job, executing my desire with Python. First, you have to install a python environment, preferably PyCharm, but you can still use VS code and Python IDLE. If you have that installed, you can then install all of the modules, wolframalpha, wikipedia, pyttsx3, pyjokes, pywhatkit, time, speech_recognition, and pyaudio. You can simply do this by searching up, "How to install (module) on python," and your first search result should give you a pip install (module), so that you can copy and paste that into your terminal/command prompt window. Once you have all the modules installed, run the program on your editor and then you are ready to go. Note:(If you get a error on installing pyaudio, you have to copy the following commands pip install pipwin pipwin install pyaudio )   Another Note:(in the func function, the variable app_id is set to “Your Api key’. The reason why I did not put my api key there is for privacy reasons. To set your api key, just simply search, how to connect to wolfram alpha api(https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-create-a-simple-assistant-using-wolfram-alpha-api/), and follow the steps on the article. Once you have gotten your api key, you can simply replace the (“YOUR API KEy”), with your personal api key.
